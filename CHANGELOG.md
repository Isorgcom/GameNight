# Changelog

All notable changes to GameNight are documented here.

---

## [v0.01564] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Password reset links always appeared expired.** Token expiry was stored using PHP's local timezone (`date()`) but compared against SQLite's `datetime('now')` which is UTC, causing every reset link to fail immediately. Fixed by using `gmdate()` so the expiry is stored in UTC.

---

## [v0.01558] — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Live RSVP updates for admins.** When an admin has an event modal open, the invite list now automatically refreshes every 4 seconds via a background poll (`event_invites_dl.php`). RSVP status changes made by any user are reflected in the admin's view without a page reload. Polling starts when the modal opens and stops when it closes.

---

## [v0.01557] — 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Event edit link in admin Events grid.** Each row in the Site Settings → Events spreadsheet now has a ▶ button that opens the event's calendar modal in a new tab, letting admins view and edit the full event details.

---

## [v0.01556] — 2026-04-03

### Removed
- **Recurring events.** Recurrence fields (`recurrence`, `recurrence_end`),
  the Recurrence dropdown in the create/edit modal, the per-occurrence invite
  scope toggle, the "Delete this date" occurrence button, and the "Recurring"
  badge on My Events have all been removed. All event queries now use a simple
  date-overlap filter. `build_event_by_date` simplified to single-pass;
  `load_exceptions` stubbed out. Admin Manage Events grid drops the Recurrence
  and Recur End columns.

---

## [v0.01555] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Manage Events tab in Site Settings.** Admins can now view and edit all
  events from a full-width spreadsheet-style grid under Site Settings → Events.
  Every cell is directly editable — title, dates, times, and recurrence — with
  changes saving automatically via AJAX and a "Saved" toast confirming each
  update. Recurrence is a dropdown select; all other fields are inline
  text/date/time inputs. The grid horizontally scrolls and breaks out of the
  960 px container so no columns are clipped. A "Manage Events" shortcut button
  was also added to the admin dashboard.

---

## [v0.01554] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Database Admin tool.** pla-ng (phpLiteAdmin fork, PHP 8 compatible) is now
  available at `/phpadmin/`. Access is gated behind the GameNight admin session —
  non-admins are redirected to login. The tool is downloaded at container startup
  by `docker-entrypoint.sh` and is not stored in the repo. A "Database Admin"
  button was added to the admin dashboard for quick access.

---

## [v0.01553] — 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **Calendar 500 error — cannot redeclare `build_event_by_date`.** A prior commit
  moved `build_event_by_date` and `load_exceptions` into `db.php` but did not
  remove them from `calendar.php`. PHP fataled on the duplicate declaration for
  every calendar page request. Removed the duplicate definitions from `calendar.php`
  and `calendar_dl.php`; canonical home is now `db.php`.

---

## [v0.01552] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **My Events page.** Logged-in users can view all events they are involved in
  (invited to or created) from a dedicated page, split into Upcoming and Past
  sections. Each card shows RSVP status, date/time, and a direct calendar link.
  "My Events" appears in both the desktop nav bar and the mobile hamburger menu.
- **Per-occurrence invites and RSVP for recurring events.** Each occurrence of a
  repeating event can now have its own invite list and RSVP statuses, independent
  of other occurrences in the series.
- **Maybe RSVP toggle.** Admins can enable or disable the "Maybe" response option
  site-wide from Site Settings → General. When disabled, Maybe is removed from RSVP
  buttons, invite emails, calendar dropdowns, and the one-click RSVP endpoint.
- **Failed login logging.** Failed login attempts are recorded in the activity log
  with `critical` severity and displayed in red in the admin Logs tab.
- **ROADMAP.md** added to the repository documenting planned milestones through v0.1.

### Fixed
- **Recurring event edit modal — save button clipped.** The edit modal uses
  `overflow:hidden` and `max-height:92vh` to stay within the viewport, but the
  `<form>` element was a plain block rather than a flex container. This meant
  `flex:1` on the body and `flex-shrink:0` on the footer had no effect — when a
  recurring event's extra scope UI added enough height, the footer with the Save
  button was pushed below the clipped edge and became unreachable. Fixed by making
  the form a flex column so the footer is always pinned at the bottom.
- **Upcoming events strip overflowing the page width.** The 7-column week grid used
  `grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr)` but grid items default to
  `min-width: auto`, so the browser sized each column to the longest event title
  rather than the available 1fr share. Adding `min-width: 0` to `.wk-cell` lets
  the existing `text-overflow: ellipsis` take effect and keeps the strip within
  the page.
- Maybe RSVP option was missing from invite notification emails; now included when
  the Maybe toggle is enabled.

## [v0.015] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **My Events page.** Logged-in users can now see all events they are involved in
  (invited to or created) from a single page. Events are split into Upcoming
  (chronological) and Past (reverse chronological) sections. Each card shows the
  RSVP status, Organizer/Recurring badges, date/time, and a direct link to the
  event on the calendar.
- "My Events" nav link added to both the desktop nav bar and the mobile hamburger
  dropdown for all logged-in users.

### Added (v0.0153)
- Fixed guests being unable to expand post comments — the `toggleComments()` JS
  function was inside a logged-in-only `<?php if ($user): ?>` block.

### Added (v0.0152)
- **Maybe RSVP toggle.** Admins can enable or disable the "Maybe" response option
  sitewide from Site Settings → General. When disabled, Maybe is removed from RSVP
  buttons, invite emails, calendar dropdowns, and the tokenized RSVP endpoint.

### Added (v0.0151)
- **Failed login logging.** Failed login attempts are now recorded in the activity
  log with severity `critical` and displayed in red in the admin Logs tab.
- `severity` column added to `activity_log` (defaults to `info`).
- Anonymous activity logging support (`db_log_anon_activity`) for events with no
  authenticated user.

## [v0.015] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Email verification for new signups.** New users must click a verification link
  sent to their email before they can log in. The verification token expires after
  24 hours and can be resent from the login page or the post-registration screen.
- Registration page now shows a "Check Your Email" confirmation screen instead of
  immediately logging in after signup.
- Unverified users who try to log in see a clear message and a one-click resend link.

### Changed
- `auth.php` fully promoted to the verification-aware implementation (`auth_dl.php`):
  all 24 pages now share the new login/register/notification logic automatically.
- Existing accounts (created before 2026-04-01) are auto-marked as verified — no
  action required from existing users or admins.
- Mobile nav bar (Home, Calendar, etc.) is now hidden on screens ≤ 768 px. All
  navigation links are accessible through the hamburger dropdown instead, keeping
  the header clean on phones and tablets.

### Fixed
- Hamburger menu was unresponsive on mobile due to `overflow: hidden` on the nav
  container clipping the absolutely-positioned dropdown, making it open but invisible.
- Touch event bubbling caused the dropdown to open and immediately close on a single
  tap. Fixed by stopping propagation in the toggle handler.
- Replaced unreliable `DOMContentLoaded` + external-JS approach with a direct inline
  `onclick` on the button, eliminating all script-load timing issues.

## [v0.014] — 2026-03

### Added
- **User-created events.** Admins can now grant regular users the ability to create
  and manage their own events via a toggle in Site Settings.
- Event owners can view and edit RSVP statuses for their own invitees directly from
  the edit modal — previously only admins could do this.
- Email field shown for non-admin custom invitee rows so manually-added guests
  receive notifications.

### Fixed
- JS permission checks for user-created events were incorrectly gated on `isAdmin`
  instead of the `canCreateEvents` flag, silently breaking the feature for non-admins.
- Long event titles on the calendar caused horizontal overflow on mobile.
- Email Event Details link no longer passes through the URL shortener, which was
  breaking session state and preventing users from opening the correct event.
- Event Details button in invite emails corrected to `inline-block` so it renders
  at the right width across email clients.
- Multiple mobile header banner height fixes: banner is now capped consistently
  across portrait and landscape orientations, preventing nav overflow.

---

## [v0.013] — 2026-02

### Added
- **One-click RSVP from email.** Invited users can accept or decline directly from
  the invite email without logging in first.
- New invitees added to an existing event are automatically notified by their
  preferred contact method (email, SMS, or WhatsApp).
- Login and Sign Up links added to the RSVP confirmation page for guests who want
  to create an account.

### Changed
- Host is no longer notified when an invitee's RSVP is unchanged (reduces noise for
  all notification channels).
- Event Details link in invite emails redesigned as a full-width blue button for
  better tap targets on mobile.

---

## [v0.012] — 2026-01

### Added
- **Multi-provider SMS system** with support for Twilio, Vonage, and Plivo. Providers
  are configurable from Site Settings without touching code.
- **Two-way SMS RSVP** — invitees can reply YES/NO to accept or decline events by text.
- **WhatsApp messaging** via Meta Cloud API (alpha). Invite notifications can be routed
  to WhatsApp in addition to email and SMS.
- **URL shortener** for outbound SMS links, using is.gd (free, no API key required).
- **Password show/hide toggle** on login and registration pages, with iOS Safari fix.
- **SMS log** — admin page showing all outbound messages, raw API responses, and a
  one-click copy button. Log can be cleared from the settings page.
- **Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions** pages added, with links in the footer.
- Inbound SMS webhook URL shown in SMS settings for easy provider configuration.

### Changed
- Admin settings reorganized: Email, SMS, and WhatsApp grouped under a single
  Communication tab.
- SMS log moved to a dedicated full-width page rather than embedded in settings.

### Fixed
- SMS log Raw column copy button was being clipped by the table.
- Outbound delivery receipt webhooks from SMS providers are now ignored (were
  flooding the log with noise).

---

## [v0.011] — 2025-12

### Added
- **Login to join** prompt for unauthenticated users viewing an event — Sign In and
  Sign Up buttons shown inline in the event view modal.
- **Auto-open event modal** after login redirect — users land directly on the event
  they were trying to view, not the home page.
- Sign Up button added next to Login in event view for guests who don't have an account.
- `register.php` now accepts a `redirect` parameter so users return to the right place
  after creating an account.

### Changed
- RSVP section moved above the Invites list in the event view modal so users see
  their own status first.
- RSVP UX overhauled: status auto-saves on selection change, status badge shown per
  invitee row, cleaner layout.
- Invites list is now scrollable showing ~5 users at a time.
- App version shown in the site footer.
- Nav banner and header now appear on the login and registration pages.

### Fixed
- Login redirect URL now correctly preserves the event open/date query parameters
  so the right event auto-opens after authentication.

---

## [v0.010] — 2025-11

### Added
- **App versioning** — version number defined in `version.php` and displayed in the
  footer.
- **Header banner** — admins can upload a wide banner image that appears in the nav
  bar, with configurable height (up to 200 px).
- **Desktop edit event modal** redesigned as a two-column layout with a searchable,
  scrollable invite checklist and per-invitee notification toggle.
- SMTP diagnostics tool added to the admin Email settings tab.

### Fixed
- SMTP settings key mismatch that prevented email from being saved correctly.
- Forced password-change flow now triggers correctly on first admin login.
- First-login credentials updated in documentation (`admin@localhost` / `admin`).
